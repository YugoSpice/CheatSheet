      <p>Chargrilled Broccoli: Cut your broccoli into florets and blanch for two minutes. You can cool the broccoli in an ice bath after blanching, but if we’re being honest, rinsing it with cold water will probably do and is easier. Coat in some olive oil, and place the broccoli on an extremely hot griddle pan in batches (don’t crowd the florets or they’ll steam), and flip them so they have char marks on both sides. Toss them in some Chipotle Garni. This makes for a great side dish, or a lovely addition to a grain or lentil salad (see the Beans/Pulses section, and the Rice/Grains/Pasta sections).</p>

      <br>
      <p>Simple Slaw Two Ways: Mix shredded cabbage and grated carrots with some Miso Chipotle mayo. This is just Miso Chipotle mixed in with mayo, using as much or as little as you like to suit your taste. You can also sub yoghurt for mayo for something lighter.  Alternatively, you can dress it with a mix of olive oil and Chipotle Garni for a fresher slaw.</p>

      <p>Easy Shakshouka: This is a really simple recipe we make at home at least twice a week which makes for a great meal on its own or served with some flatbread. Slice an onion and sweat it out in a pan with some salt until soft (but not caramelised). Add a few diced tomatoes and cook until they form a thick sauce. Beat a few eggs, season, and pour over the tomatoes and onion. Cover for a few minutes until the eggs are cooked. Sometimes I like to mix it up and add a few tablespoons of Curried Sun-Dried Tomato when I add the tomatoes.</p>

      <p>Miso Glazed Salmon: Slather salmon in Miso Chipotle and cook in a pan or in the oven (according to package instructions), and you’re onto a winner. Really great served over noodles or rice with a side of veg.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Creamy Sun-Dried Tomato Salmon: Season your salmon fillet and cook in an oiled pan for 2-3 minutes on each side, then set aside. In the same pan, sauté a diced onion, then add a few heaped tablespoons of Curried Sun-Dried Tomato and cook until fragrant. Add a dash of vegetable stock to reach your desired consistency and simmer. Add a few spoonfuls of cream to form a creamy sauce, and add your salmon back in. This goes extremely well with pasta.</p>

      <p>Blackened Cod Tacos: Coat your cod fillets in Chipotle Garni, and on high heat, cook your cod for two minutes on each side. Don’t worry about the black bits forming; that’s what’ll give them the charred flavour we’re after. Serve your taco with spicy mayo (Chipotle Garni + mayo) and a fresh salsa of diced tomatoes, onions, coriander and lime (don’t forget to season with salt!).</p>
      <br>
      <p>Cod Ramen: Marinate cod in a mix of Miso Chipotle and grated ginger. In the meantime, cook a portion of soba noodles and set aside. Pan-fry your fish for 2-3 minutes on each side and set aside. In an oiled wok, stir-fry pak choi or any other greens until they start to wilt. Add 250mL of vegetable stock, and season with a small amount of light soy, oyster, and fish sauces (or Miso Chipotle if you haven’t got all that), and heat through. In a bowl, add your noodles, and top with the broth and cod fillet.</p>

      <p>Miso Chipotle Prawn Bowl: quickly pan-fry your prawns with Miso Chipotle. Serve with sautéed courgettes and sliced avocado on a bed of rice.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Curried Scallops: Pan fry your scallops (a few minutes on each side should do it. Be careful not to overcook them). Take them off the heat and keep warm. Sautee finely diced onions with Curried Sun-Dried Tomato until soft. Blend the onion mixture until smooth, adding vegetable broth as necessary and a dash of cream. Add back to the pan with the scallops. Serve over pasta or rice.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Chipotle Scallops: Pan fry your scallops (a few minutes on each side should do it. Be careful not to overcook them). Take them off the heat and keep warm. In the same pan, add a generous amount of Chipotle Garni and a small amount of orange juice. Mix and reduce to the desired consistency and taste for seasoning. Add the scallops back in to coat, and serve over pasta or rice.</p>

      <p>Tuna Jacket Potato: Mix a drained can of tuna with a spoonful of Curried Sun-Dried Tomato, some grated carrot, and a tiny bit of mayonnaise. Stuff into a jacket potato, and top with grated cheese and pop into the over until the cheese is melty. This filling would also make for a great tuna melt.</p>
